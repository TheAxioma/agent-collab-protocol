## 1. Protocol Overview

The core problem is the ordering-vs-meaning gap. Causal ordering between agents is largely solved. What isn't: two agents with perfectly synchronized clocks can still work on completely different interpretations of the same task. task_hash looks identical; execution diverges silently. This protocol addresses that by co-designing semantic agreement alongside causal ordering — a canonical task schema where intent, scope, and expected artifacts are explicit and hashable.

- Lightweight, transport-agnostic message format
- Decentralized identity and discovery
- Explicit role negotiation before task execution
- Canonical task schema with semantic and syntactic identity
- Progress reporting and structured error handling

### 6.1 Canonical Task Schema

A task is the atomic unit of agent collaboration. Every task MUST carry explicit semantic fields alongside syntactic identity to prevent silent divergence.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| task_id | UUID v4 | Globally unique instance identifier |
| task_hash | SHA-256 | Hash of canonical task definition (syntactic identity) |
| intent | string | Semantic description of what the task is meant to accomplish |
| scope | object | Explicit boundaries — what is in scope and what is not |
| expected_artifacts | array | Outputs the delegating agent expects to receive |
| constraints | object | Time, resource, and permission limits |
| namespace | string | Reverse-DNS namespace to prevent cross-ecosystem collision (e.g. com.example.tasks) |
| alias | string | Human-readable shorthand for the task type within a namespace |
| version | semver | Schema version for forward compatibility |
| issued_at | ISO 8601 | Issuance timestamp |
| issuer_id | string | Identity of the delegating agent |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| trace_hash | SHA-256 | Post-execution hash derived from executing agent's actual trace — semantic interpretation signal |
| parent_task_id | UUID | For subtasks: reference to parent task |
| timeout_seconds | integer | Max execution time before zombie state (see §8) |

### 6.2 task_hash vs. trace_hash

task_hash encodes syntactic identity: two tasks with the same task_hash are definitionally equivalent. Computed by the delegating agent before delegation.

trace_hash encodes semantic interpretation: what the executing agent actually did. Populated post-execution. Divergence between expected behavior and actual trace_hash is the primary signal of semantic drift. Agents SHOULD log both for audit. Orchestrators MAY use trace_hash divergence as a renegotiation trigger (see §7).

### 6.3 Namespace and Alias

namespace uses reverse-DNS notation to prevent task type collisions across ecosystems. namespace + alias + version uniquely identifies a task type. task_id uniquely identifies a task instance.

### 6.4 Task Hash Computation

task_hash = SHA-256(canonical_json(task_schema))

canonical_json MUST produce deterministic output regardless of key insertion order. Implementations SHOULD follow RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme). Exclude task_hash and post-execution fields (trace_hash) from hash input.

### 6.5 Delegation Protocol

1. Delegating agent constructs task schema, computes task_hash, sets issued_at
2. Task transmitted to executing agent via message format (§4)
3. Executing agent acknowledges receipt (§7)
4. Executing agent completes work, populates trace_hash, transmits result
5. Delegating agent verifies task_hash integrity; optionally validates trace_hash against expected behavior

## 8. Error Handling

### 8.1 Zombie State Definition

An agent is in **zombie state** when it continues executing after its state has diverged from shared context. No internal discontinuity signal exists — self-report fails because the agent has no evidence of the gap.

### 8.2 Detection Primitives

**State hash on commit:** SHA-256 of state before any write. Mismatch between expected and actual hash MUST reject the write and surface the error. Prevents corruption propagation downstream; ghost work still occurs but blast radius stays local.

**Monotonic counter:** Sequence number tracked by each side. A recovered agent with a lower sequence number than its peer knows it missed events. Detects transmission gaps without cryptographic overhead.

**SESSION_RESUME handshake:** Three-message protocol:

1. Resuming agent sends `SESSION_RESUME(state_hash)`
2. Peer responds with `STATE_HASH_ACK(match|mismatch)`
3. On match → `RESUME`; on mismatch → `RESTART` (teardown and re-init)

Hash match = resume; mismatch = teardown and re-init.

### 8.3 Known Limitations

**Identical-trace failure mode:** Two agents can produce matching traces for different internal reasons. Behavioral similarity does not imply semantic identity.

**TEE attestation boundary:** `trace_hash` (§6.2) proves what was executed; TEE attestation proves where execution occurred; memory poisoning attacks the data between them. These MUST be paired, not conflated.

**Adversarial drift:** Out of v0.1 scope. This section covers the cooperative threat model only. Adversarial semantic drift requires different primitives — reserved for §9.

### 8.4 Coordination Patterns

**Teardown-by-default:** Resume is a negotiated capability, not a default. Resume requires both sides to serialize state identically — that compatibility surface fails in practice more than theory predicts.

**Protocol-layer heartbeat:** Heartbeat at the protocol layer, not the transport layer. Transport-layer solutions produce N dialects. A configurable-interval `KEEPALIVE` at the protocol layer is more weight but less surprise.

**Session registry tradeoff:** A registry provides consistency at the cost of availability (registry failure removes both agents' coordination anchor). Independent timeout provides availability at the cost of consistency (asymmetric state on recovery). Both patterns are valid; both failure modes SHOULD be named explicitly in deployment configuration.

### 8.5 Design Goal

The protocol's goal is not to prevent zombie states. It is to make them **detectable** and **bound their blast radius**. A zombie that propagates silently causes more damage than one that fails loudly.

**Relationship to other sections:**

- The `timeout_seconds` optional field in §6 task schema triggers zombie state detection.
- `trace_hash` (§6.2) is the primary semantic drift signal for post-execution verification.
- §9 Security Considerations handles adversarial drift and TEE attestation architecture.
